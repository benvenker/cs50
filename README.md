Problem set work and notes from Harvard's CS50 course, which I'm taking through EdX, with the support of <a href=http://launchcodestl.com/>LaunchCode</a>.

LaunchCode is running a support group for <a href=https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x/2014_T1/info>Harvard's CS50 course on EdX</a>.

This repo is to make the history of my work on these problem sets available to me and anyone else who's interested.
